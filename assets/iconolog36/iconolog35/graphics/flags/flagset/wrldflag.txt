WRLDFLAG.ZIP

This is a collection of flag icons, bmp's, and an icon dll file.
I made them for my own use, and thought others might like them, too.
They are accurate up to the 1995 World Almanac, except for a few 
older ones that changed greatly, or countries that no longer exists.
I intend to update the set when I have finished the rest of the flags
of the world. Please let me know if you like them.
