 <h4>So why gif an icon?</h4>
 <p><b>
  Primarily because unlike the humble .ico or .xpm you can take a gif almost anywhere.

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The gif collection began as the web display section for The Iconolog, a collection of 22,963 windows icons. Over 2000 icons were selected to form the basis of the collection in gif format. The ongoing collection has since been extended to include icons from a number of sources, including the best of the 32x32 images from <a href="http://www.sct.gu.edu.au/~anthony/icons/">Aicons V1.8</a> originally in .xpm format.</p>
<p align="justify">The purpose of the collection is to provide a basic resource of 32x32 icons in a form that is accessible on all platforms. The major criteria for addition to the collection are that the icon portrays something not already present or that it is the work of an iconographer not yet represented. The current gif collection contains 7419 icons.</p>
<p align="justify">The original icons were collected wherever I found them, few icons were credited. Any information regarding sources would be appreciated, &#38; please, if an icon belongs to you, advise me so that I may add credits or remove the image in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<a name="index"></a>
<p align="justify">All images in the iconolog are considered copyright but I do not necessarily own the copyright or know the source. Any further information about sources would be appreciated, if an icon belongs to you, please email me, it will be credited or removed in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<p align="justify">Where the source of an icon is known, the Iconographer is listed on the <a href="contributors.html">contributors</a> page &amp; beneath the icon on the relevant display page. Many of these are available for personal/non-profit use but you should check the copyright owners conditions.</p>
<p align="justify">The Iconolog is divided into major subject categories & then by subject into the display sections. Indexes are alphabetic by category then subject. These pages are designed to use a frameset, if your browser does not support frames, use your usual graphics pages can be accessed from the <a href="_html/navIndex.html"></a></p>
<p align="justify">Did I file it where you would <i>never</i> have found it? Please ask. Queries? Comments? Recommendations? Additions? <a href="mailto:afactor@afactor.net">email</a> me. Please check <a href="http://www.iconolog.net/">The Iconolog</a> online for further information or new additions to the collection.</p>

<center><h4>Thank you, all iconographers.</h4>
