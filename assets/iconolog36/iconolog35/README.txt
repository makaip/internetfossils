             The Best of The Iconolog 

            The Art of Virtual Litter
            

To use the included html to browse the collection, 
open /iconolog35/index.html with your browser.

The Iconolog must be de-archived with the directory
structure intact to use the html. The gif collection takes
advantage of the longer filenames, allowing more precise
naming. If your system does not support longer filenames,
gifs with longer filenames will be abbreviated causing them
to appear as broken images in your browser. View these images

Minimal information extracted from The Iconolog html

The gif collection began as the web display section for The
Iconolog, the original Windows ico collection of 22,963 .ico.
The collection has since been extended to include icons from
a number of sources, including the best of the 32x32 images
from Aicons V1.8 originally in .xpm format.

The purpose of the ongoing collection in .gif format is to 
provide a basic resource of 32x32 icons in a form that is
accessible on all platforms. The major criteria for addition
to the collection are that the icon portrays something not
already present or that it is the work of an iconographer
not yet represented.

Copyright in The Iconolog is complicated - copyright is
complicated! All images in the iconolog are considered
copyright but I do not necessarily own the copyright or know
the source. If an icon belongs to you or you know the source,
please email me. 

Where the source of an icon is known, the Iconographer is
listed on the Contributors page & also beneath the icon on
the relevant display page, most of these are available for
personal/non-profit use but you should check the copyright
owners conditions. 

           Thank you, all iconographers.


Did I file it where you would never have found it? Please ask.
Queries? Comments? Recommendations? Additions? Email me & if
I don't hear from you, I hope you enjoy the collection.
